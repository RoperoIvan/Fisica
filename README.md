## List of differencies

- Our pinball does not have the same sounds and music.

- The dock animation is not the same.

- It does not have the button's animations ( audio and music mutes), but they work.

- The numbers are not the same font as the original.

- The little bouncer in the bottom-left part of the pinball has been moved a little bit to the right.

- The values of the restitution in bouncers and the dock's force probably is not the same.


## Controls

- LEFT ARROW = move the left flipper.

- RIGHT ARROW = move the right flipper.

- BOTTOM ARROW = shoot the ball with the dock.

- R = restart when you lose the game.

- LEFT MOUSE BUTTON = if you click in the music or sound icon you will mute the music of the game. If you click again you will unmute the music. / Also if you click and hold the ball you will be able to drag it. If you release it the joint will disappear.

- SPACEBAR = to pass between the initial scene and the lose scene.

- F1 = you will see the debug mode.

## Combos

We have implented 2 different combos:

- When you turn all the blue circles orange, you will recieve 40 extra points.

- When you turn on the bouncers, and they are "bright" you will recieve 50 extra points.
